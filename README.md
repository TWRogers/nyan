nyan (**n**ot **y**our **a**verage **n**ame) is an image pre-processing and post-processing library built on top of 
[Pillow](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/), [numpy](https://numpy.org/)
[OpenCV-Python](https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_tutorials.html), and
[imagio](https://pypi.org/project/imageio/).

The library is designed for Computer Vision tasks, where you (i) pre-process, (ii) perform inference producing bounding 
boxes or segmentation masks, and (iii) transform those results back to the original image space for visualisation with 
the image.
